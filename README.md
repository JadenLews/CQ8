# CQ8
Staircase: Time complexity- O(n^2) there is a initial for loop that runs for the size of n, and within that for loop there are two separate for loops that run some fraction of n, which makes it n(n/c + n/c) which is O(n^2)
Space complexity: This program uses three for loops which makes the space constant because there will only ever be 3 for loops O(1)
